# How to set up everything yellowbeetletogether 2.0 server 
Minecraft 1.17, last updated 27/06.21

### 1. Download all files from this repository
Click the green 'Code' button and then select 'Download ZIP'. Doesn't matter where they go for the moment, but unzip and open up the folder when you've downloaded them.

### 2. Install Fabric
Double click to run the file 'fabric-installer-0.7.4.jar'
You'll get a window like this:

Make sure the version is 1.17 and the install location is a '.minecraft' folder
Click to install

### 3. Move the other mods into the right folder
Move all of the other mods into the 'mods' folder in your '.minecraft' folder. This can be found by:

  Windows - open the 'Run' app from the search bar, and type 'appdata' into the Open input. Click OK, and this should bring you to a folder called 'AppData'. From here, the file path is Roaming > .minecraft > mods
  
  Mac - idk yet ill update this when jasper needs it
  
Move all of the downloaded mod files into that folder. The current list is:
- Fabric API
- Voxel Map
- Secret Rooms
- Villager Names
- Wraith Waystones (may be removed, not sure yet)

### 4. Run Minecraft on the Fabric launcher
When you start up the Minecraft Loader, select the option to use the Fabric 1.17 loader instead of the regular 1.17 loader.
